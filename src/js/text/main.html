			<h1>Where political parties get their money: unmasking associated entities</h1>
			<div class="standFirst">Some of the largest donors to the two main political parties in Australia weren’t wealthy individuals or businesses – they were companies set up by the parties themselves known as “associated entities”. So what are they, and where do they get their money from?</div>

						<p>These are the largest donors as reported by the parties themselves, by total the total amount of money given. We're using the phrase "donors" as the Australian electoral commission uses it, which is anyone that gives the parties money, regardless of whether it was a "donation" or some other type of payment.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="scrollerSection">
					<div class='gv-flex-3'>
						<p>On the right, you can see the largest amount comes from public funding, through the <span class="donor">NSW electoral commission</span>. There are also individual donors here, such as mining magnate <span class="donor">Paul Marks</span>. On the left are the associated entities. The largest associated entity donor to the Liberal party was the <span class='assEnt'>Cormack Foundation</span>, and the largest associated entity donor to the Labor party is was <span class='assEnt'>Labor Holdings Pty Ltd</span>. Both of these entities, rather than receiving donations, rely on their investments to funnel money to their respective political parties.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="scrollerSection">
					<div class='gv-flex-3'>
						<p>Technically, an associated entity can be any organisation, so long as it is either controlled by a political party, is a financial member or has voting rights in a political party, or operates wholly (or to a significant extent) to benefit a political party.</p>
						<p>In practice, this includes everything from the Free Enterprise Foundation, <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/02/a-tale-of-two-charitable-foundations-and-a-flood-of-donations-to-the-liberals' target='_blank'>made infamous for “washing” banned NSW donations from property developers</a>, unions such as the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, and thinktanks like the Menzies Research Centre.</p>

					<p>Here, I’ve mapped out the entities and donors associated with every significant political party, where they get their money from and how much they give to the parties. This allows you to see the flow of money from start to finish, which is ordinarily difficult as each of the parties, entities and donors declare their donations to the Australian Electoral Commission separately.</p>
					<p>Each donation is represented by an arrow, classified by the party or entity as a <span class="donor">"donation"</span> or <span class="otherReceipt">"other receipt"</span>. The circles show entities, with the solid colour indicating the type of entity, and the outline is coloured depending on their most frequent transaction - <span class="donor">"donation"</span>, <span class="otherReceipt">"other receipt"</span> or  <span class="otherReceipt">mixed</span>. You can click the info button at any time to see a key, or hover or tap the circles to see more information.</p>
					<p><span class="assEnt">The Cormack Foundation</span> was set up decades ago from the proceeds of the sale of Melbourne radio station 3XY and is frequently one of the largest donors to the <span class="liberalParty">Liberal party</span> in any financial year. Rather than receiving donations, the Foundation relies on investments to funnel money to the Coalition.</p>
					<p>Unusually, in the 2015-16 financial year, it also gave money to Senator David Leyonhjelm’s party, the <span class="minorParty">Liberal Democrats</span>, and <span class="minorParty">Family First</span>.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="scrollerSection">
					<div class='gv-flex-3'>
					<p><span class="assEnt">Labor Holdings</span> is the <span class="laborParty">Labor party’s</span> investment entity and, similar to the Cormack Foundation, was set up from the sale of Labor party radio station 4KQ in 1987. Again, it relies on investments rather than donations to gain funds for the Labor parties.</p>

					<p>So, how do the two major parties compare?</p>
					<p>Here's the federal branch of the Liberal Party.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="scrollerSection">
					<div class='gv-flex-3'>
					<p>And here's the Labor party. Because unions are required to report as associated entities, the network of how funds get to Labor is significantly more complex.</p>
