						<p>The largest donors to the two main political parties in Australia weren’t wealthy individuals or businesses – they were companies set up by the parties themselves known as “associated entities”.</p>
						<p>Technically, an associated entity can be any organisation, so long as it is either controlled by a political party, is a financial member or has voting rights in a political party, or operates wholly (or to a significant extent) to benefit a political party.</p>
						<p>In practice, this includes everything from the Free Enterprise Foundation, made infamous for “washing” banned NSW donations from property developers, unions such as the CFMEU and thinktanks like the Menzies Research Centre.</p>

						<p>In the 2015 election period, the two largest associated entities in terms of donations to the Labor and Liberal parties were the Cormack Foundation and Labor Holdings Pty Ltd.</p>
						<p>Here, I’ve mapped out the entities and donors associated with every significant political party, where they get their money from and how much they give to the parties. This allows you to see the flow of money from start to finish, which is ordinarily difficult as each of the parties, entities and donors declare their donations to the Australian Electoral Commission separately.</p>
						<p>Both The Cormack Foundation and Labor Holdings, rather than receiving donations, rely on their investments to funnel money to their respective political parties.</p>
						<p>The Cormack Foundation was set up decades ago from the proceeds of the sale of Melbourne radio station 3XY and is frequently one of the largest donors to the Liberal party in any financial year. Unusually, in the 2015-16 financial year, it also gave money to Senator David Leyonhjelm’s party, the Liberal Democrats, and Family First.</p>

					<p>Labor Holdings is the Labor party’s investment entity and, similar to the Cormack Foundation, was set up from the sale of Labor party radio station 4KQ in 1987.</p>

					<p>So how do the major parties compare?</p>
